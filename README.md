Solution to Year 12 class assignment using a simulated queue of dictionaries in Python 3

ASSIGNMENT
Beginner:  

Create a program that stores data about shirts that a small online retailer has for sale. The user should be able to: 

    Store as many shirts as they wish in to a suitable data structure.  

    Each shirt must a have colour and pattern stored for it (e.g. plain white or blue check) 

    The user should be able to print the details of the most recent shirt added 

    The user should be able to print a list of all shirts added 

Intermediate :  

Develop the program to also allow the user to: 

    Store the price of each shirt 

    Choose a shirt from the data structure of all items and remove it  

    Allow the user to search for all shirts that match the colour entered 

    Choose a shirt from the data structure of all items and change its price without removing and re-adding 

Advanced: 

Develop the program to also allow the user to: 

    Store a 'style' for each shirt (e.g. short or long-sleeved) 

    Print a list of all shirts ordered by price 

    Print a list of all shirts in the order entered 

    Print a list of all shirts that are pink and short-sleeved or blue and checked 


 

Marks will be awarded for: 

    Functionality of the code against the brief (10 marks) 

    Demonstrating good programming practice (e.g. comments, names of variables and subroutines)(5 marks) 

    Appropriate use of subroutines (10 marks) 

    Validation of the use input (see screenshot) (5 marks) 

    Error handling (e.g. try/except, while loops for input validation) (5 marks) 

    Good user interface (a menu of some description) (5 marks) 

    Evidence of iterative development (submit at least 3 different version of your code clearly showing how you have solved a problem / added features between each version) (5 marks) 

    Apparent use of own research (add links in your comments to pages used for ideas) (5 marks)
